# High-Dimensional $L^2$-Optimal Control Steerage with the Controllability Gramian Approach on LTI Benchmarks
This repository implements the solution to the finite-horizon Minimum Energy Optimal Control problem for two high-dimensional, Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems: an 8-state densely coupled mechanical system and a 10-state power system model. The aim is to steer the system from an initial distrubance to the origin in a fixed time while minimizing the tital control effort.

# Technical Rigor
Optimal Control Theory and Numerical Methods

# Benchmarks 
8D Densely Coupled System - An under-actuated system designed for maximal, non-local physical cross coupling, such that every mode of oscillation is intertwined. 
10D Power System Model - A linearized 5-generator model for designing Power System Stabilizers (PSS) while demonstrating control authority constraints.

# Execution
Install all dependencies and run the code to produce the results and plots.
